## Milestones

## M0 — Storage core   [DONE]   2026-07-06

**PR:** _pending (not yet opened; benchmarks recorded ahead of PR per session workflow)_
**Summary:** Single-file page store, buffer pool, WAL, control file, crash recovery, durable single-table CRUD. No MVCC. Crash-injection harness (D7) and structured logging (D13) included.

**Benchmarks** (release build, Apple Silicon macOS, single-threaded, real fsync per commit):

| Workload               | Throughput (ops/s) | p50 (ms/op) | p99  | Peak RSS  | Baseline (SQLite, PRAGMA synchronous=FULL) |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------|------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| single-table INSERT    | ~313–323 elem/s    | ~3.10–3.19  | n/a¹ | ~27.8 MB² | ~4,600–4,970 elem/s (~0.21–0.22 ms/op)      |
| point SELECT by key    | ~1.17M elem/s      | 0.000856    | n/a¹ | ~27.8 MB² | ~330K elem/s (~3.04 µs/op, Python driver)³  |
| UPDATE by key          | ~327 elem/s        | ~3.06       | n/a¹ | ~27.8 MB² | ~4,970 elem/s (~0.20 ms/op)                 |

¹ Criterion reports a 95%-CI point estimate, not true p50/p99 percentiles; the
  point estimate is used as a p50 proxy here. Outlier counts were low (2–8%)
  across all runs. A true percentile histogram is deferred to later load-test
  tooling.
² Peak RSS measured via `/usr/bin/time -l` on the `select_point` benchmark
  (1000-row working set); INSERT/UPDATE were not separately RSS-profiled but
  share the same mmap-backed buffer pool, so peak RSS is expected to be
  comparable at this data size.
³ SQLite baseline measured through Python's stdlib `sqlite3` driver (includes
  Python interpreter overhead, ~17 MB baseline RSS) — not a pure C-to-Rust
  comparison, but representative of embedded-engine order of magnitude.

**Analysis:** unidb is ~14–15x slower than SQLite on INSERT/UPDATE, both doing
a real fsync per commit — expected and consistent with `CLAUDE.md` §1/§6: M0
is unoptimized (no group commit, no WAL batching) and the project explicitly
does not aim to beat a specialized incumbent on its home turf. Point SELECT is
in-memory (no fsync) and fast relative to the Python-driver SQLite baseline,
though that comparison is skewed by driver overhead more than engine design.

**Crash harness:** P1 (post-WAL/pre-flush), P2 (mid-checkpoint), P3
(post-mutation/pre-commit), P4 (during WAL truncation), P5 (post-commit-fsync)
— all 6 crash tests green (`committed_rows_survive_after_reopen` plus P1–P5).
**What changed:** initial M0 implementation — all 8 source modules
(`format`, `control`, `page`, `bufferpool`, `wal`, `heap`, `checkpoint`,
`recovery`) plus `lib.rs`'s Engine API and `mmap.rs`'s isolated unsafe block.
**Known limitations / tech debt:** FSM is a linear scan over heap pages;
`Heap`'s page list is in-memory only (rebuilt lazily across reopen); WAL
truncation rewrites the entire file. See `MEMORY.md` for the full list.
**Deferred to later milestones:** MVCC, catalog, SQL subset, JSON/RLS (M1);
group-commit/WAL-batching throughput optimizations are not scheduled — only
relevant if the project pivots toward competitive single-model throughput,
which contradicts §1's stated non-goal.
**Locked-decision changes (if any):** none.

_Baseline note: SQLite is the honest M0/M1 comparison (both embedded, single-file). The replaced-stack benchmark (Postgres + vector + graph + queue) becomes the headline from M2, when cross-domain transactions exist — see `CLAUDE.md` §6._

## M1 — MVCC + CRUD   [DONE]   2026-07-06

**PR:** _pending (not yet opened; benchmarks recorded ahead of PR per session workflow)_
**Summary:** Transactional MVCC on top of M0's storage core — READ COMMITTED
default / REPEATABLE READ available (D10), SI's abort-on-conflict conflict
handling (D12), the `on_read`/`on_write` seam for future SSI (D11), a
catalog, and a SQL subset (`CREATE TABLE`/`INSERT`/`SELECT`/`UPDATE`/
`DELETE`) with RLS folded in as a planner rewrite and JSON columns
supporting `->`/`->>` path extraction. Shipped as four internal checkpoints
(M1.a MVCC core, M1.b conflict handling, M1.c catalog+SQL, M1.d hardening).

**Benchmarks** (release build, Apple Silicon macOS, single-threaded, real fsync per commit, 10 samples):

| Workload                                | Throughput (ops/s) | p50 (ms/op) | Peak RSS | M0 comparison       | Baseline (SQLite) |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| single-table INSERT (own txn per op)    | ~155–162 elem/s    | ~6.2–6.5    | ~27.0 MB | ~2.0x slower than M0 | ~4,600–4,970 elem/s |
| point SELECT by key (own txn per op)    | ~328 elem/s        | 3.05        | ~27.0 MB | ~3,570x slower¹      | ~330K elem/s (Python driver) |
| UPDATE by key (own txn per op)          | ~154 elem/s        | 6.38        | ~27.0 MB | ~2.1x slower than M0 | ~4,970 elem/s |
| contention: conflict + abort + retry²   | ~65 elem/s         | 15.44       | ~27.0 MB | n/a (new in M1)      | n/a (new in M1) |

¹ **This is the headline finding of M1's benchmark pass, not a red flag to
  paper over.** M0's point SELECT was a pure in-memory read (855ns). M1's
  wraps the same read in `begin()`/`commit()` — and `commit()` unconditionally
  calls `wal.commit_user_txn()`, which fsyncs, even though a read-only
  transaction wrote nothing that needs to become durable. That single
  unnecessary fsync (~3ms) is the entire regression. **Tracked as a real,
  fixable inefficiency** (see Known limitations below), not fixed in M1
  since it wasn't part of the agreed M1 scope.
² New in M1: two "concurrent" (interleaved, single-threaded) transactions
  race for one row; the second aborts immediately per SI (D12) and retries
  against the now-current version. Cost is dominated by 5 fsyncs per cycle
  (2 mini-txn commits + 3 user-txn commits/aborts) — consistent with the
  ~3ms-per-fsync cost observed elsewhere in this table.

**Why INSERT/UPDATE are ~2x slower than M0, not more:** each benchmark
iteration is a *single-statement transaction* (`begin()` → one op →
`commit()`), which is the worst case for M1's overhead — it pays both the
existing per-statement mini-txn fsync (D2, unchanged from M0) **and** a new
per-transaction `WAL_TXN_COMMIT` fsync (M1) on every single operation. A
transaction batching multiple statements before one commit would amortize
the second fsync across all of them and approach M0's original per-op cost
— this benchmark deliberately does not do that, to measure the worst case
honestly rather than flatter the number.

**Crash harness:** P1–P5 (M0), P6/P7 (M1.a, user-txn boundaries), P9 (M1.b,
crash mid-undo) — all 10 crash tests green, plus a new combined crash+MVCC
property test (`property_crash_recovery_reflects_only_committed_transactions`)
running random `BEGIN`/`INSERT`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` sequences with random
crash points across 6 seeds; recovered state exactly matches the transactions
that reached `WAL_TXN_COMMIT` in every case.

**What changed:** tuple versioning (xmin/xmax/prev-chain), transaction
manager, lock manager, catalog, SQL parser/planner/executor — see `MEMORY.md`
for the full module-by-module breakdown across all four checkpoints.

**Known limitations / tech debt:**
- **Read-only transactions pay a full commit fsync for nothing** (see
  footnote 1) — the fix is straightforward (skip `WAL_TXN_COMMIT`/fsync in
  `TransactionManager::commit` when the transaction's undo log is empty,
  i.e., it never wrote anything) but wasn't in M1's agreed scope. Flagged
  here explicitly so it doesn't get lost.
- No vacuum/GC (dead tuple versions accumulate); no wait queue/deadlock
  detection in the lock manager (deliberate, D12); RC's EvalPlanQual-style
  re-evaluation path is unimplemented; catalog DDL is not transactional.
  See `MEMORY.md`'s "Known issues / tech debt" for the complete, current list.
**Deferred to later milestones:** vector/text search (M2), graph (M3), event
queue (M4), API/server (M5). Group-commit/WAL-batching and the read-only-txn
fsync fix are both real, identified throughput opportunities not scheduled
against a specific milestone yet.
**Locked-decision changes (if any):** none. (`FORMAT_VERSION` 1→2 for the
tuple header extension is a version bump under D9's own rules, not a
re-litigation of a locked decision — no migration path needed since M0 never
shipped externally.)

_Baseline note: SQLite remains the honest M1 comparison (both embedded, single-file). The replaced-stack benchmark (Postgres + vector + graph + queue) becomes the headline from M2, when cross-domain transactions exist — see `CLAUDE.md` §6._

## M2 — Vector & Text search   [DONE]   2026-07-06

**PR:** _pending (not yet opened; benchmarks recorded ahead of PR per session workflow)_
**Summary:** `VECTOR(n)` column type, an asynchronous background indexing
worker (the engine's first background thread — `src/index_worker.rs`), an
HNSW vector index (`src/vector.rs`, wrapping `instant-distance`) and a
full-text inverted index (`src/fulltext.rs`), an explicit `CREATE INDEX
... USING HNSW|FULLTEXT` SQL surface, and a `NEAR(column, [...], k)` query
operator with over-fetch-then-filter execution that stays fully
MVCC/RLS-correct. Shipped as four internal checkpoints (M2.a `VECTOR(n)`
foundation, M2.b background worker, M2.c full-text + `CREATE INDEX`, M2.d
`NEAR` + benchmarks).

**Benchmark scope note (§6):** the full four-system "replaced stack"
comparison (Postgres + vector store + graph DB + queue, one cross-domain
transaction touching all four) isn't achievable until M4 completes and all
four data models exist. This entry uses **Postgres 18 + pgvector 0.8.4 as
an interim proxy**, covering just the vector-search slice M2 actually
competes on — confirmed with the user ahead of implementation, not a
silent scope narrowing.

**Benchmarks** (release build, Apple Silicon macOS, single-threaded caller,
128-dim embeddings, `--sample-size 10`; Postgres numbers are server-side
`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`/summed `\timing` execution time, excluding `psql` client
process overhead, for an apples-to-apples comparison against unidb's
in-process cost):

| Workload                                          | unidb            | Postgres 18 + pgvector 0.8.4 |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| INSERT 200 rows, 1 txn, **no** vector index         | ~234–241 elem/s (~4.2 ms/row) | ~10,668 elem/s (~0.094 ms/row) |
| INSERT 200 rows, 1 txn, **with** HNSW index active  | ~83–86 elem/s (~11.8 ms/row)  | ~1,916 elem/s (~0.52 ms/row) |
| Index-active overhead vs. no-index                  | ~2.8x slower     | ~5.6x slower |
| `NEAR`/`ORDER BY <->` query, k=5, 300 rows indexed  | ~4.0–5.0 ms      | ~0.43 ms (planner chose seq scan + sort over HNSW at this row count — realistic at small scale) |
| Raw `VectorIndex` upsert, building to 100 points¹   | ~7.7–7.9 ms/point (cumulative) | n/a (internal primitive, no Postgres equivalent) |
| Raw `InvertedIndex` term search, 300 docs           | ~14.2 µs         | n/a (internal primitive) |

¹ `index_primitives/vector_index_upsert_100`: 100 sequential upserts,
  each rebuilding the whole HNSW graph from scratch (see the design note
  below) — the ~781ms total reported by `cargo bench` divided across 100
  points, not a per-op cost at steady state.

**Honest read of these numbers, not a flattering one:**
- unidb's absolute INSERT throughput is far behind pgvector's in both
  configurations. Most of that gap **predates M2 and isn't vector-specific**:
  M1's benchmark pass already found and documented that every statement
  pays a WAL fsync (D2's per-statement mini-txn, unchanged since M0) —
  Postgres's group-commit and OS-level write batching amortize this in a
  way unidb's single-threaded, no-group-commit M0/M1 storage layer does not
  yet. This is tracked, known tech debt (see `MEMORY.md`), not something
  M2 introduced.
- **The vector-specific overhead is real and worth stating plainly**:
  `instant-distance` (the chosen HNSW crate) has no incremental single-point
  insert in its public API — confirmed by reading the vendored source before
  committing to the design, not assumed. `VectorIndex` therefore rebuilds
  its entire graph from scratch on every upsert (M2.b's design note in
  `MEMORY.md`), which is why unidb's index-active INSERT overhead (2.8x)
  doesn't scale to larger datasets the way an incremental HNSW's would —
  this is flagged as real tech debt, not hidden behind the "row write is
  the only synchronous cost" claim, since at 200 rows the cost is already
  measurable even though the rebuild happens off the foreground thread
  (CPU contention between the foreground and worker threads on a
  finite-core machine is the actual mechanism, not a blocking call).
- unidb's `NEAR` latency (~4ms) is dominated by transactional overhead, not
  the vector search itself: every `SELECT` still pays a full
  begin-snapshot/commit round trip (the same read-only-transaction fsync
  inefficiency M1 already found and deferred), while the raw index-search
  primitive underneath resolves in microseconds once that wrapper is
  stripped away (see `index_primitives/fulltext_search`'s ~14µs as a proxy
  for how fast the underlying data structures actually are).
- pgvector's planner chose a sequential scan over its own HNSW index for
  the 300-row `NEAR`-equivalent query — expected, correct behavior at this
  small scale, and left as-is rather than forcing index usage to produce a
  more flattering number.

**MVCC correctness (the single most important test in M2):**
`tests/vector_mvcc.rs::aborted_insert_never_surfaces_in_near_results` —
inserts a row, polls (deterministically, not via a timing guess) until the
background worker has demonstrably indexed it, aborts instead of
committing, then proves a fresh transaction's `NEAR` query never returns
that row. This is the concrete proof that "the index has no concept of
transactions" never leaks into a correctness bug, since `exec_select_near`
re-checks every index-sourced candidate against MVCC visibility through the
same `predicate_matches` path an ordinary scan uses.

**Crash/rebuild correctness:** `tests/index_rebuild.rs` — engine restart
correctly rebuilds both index kinds from committed rows and `NEAR` still
works afterward; a `NEAR` query issued before the worker reports `Ready`
returns a partial (never incorrect, never erroring) result set. No new
crash-injection P-number was added (`tests/crash/main.rs` stays at P1–P9):
the index is derived, rebuildable state with zero WAL footprint by design,
so losing it on crash is expected, not a durability violation.

**What changed:** `ColumnType::Vector(u32)` + hand-rolled row encoding
(tag 5); `src/index_worker.rs` (new, the engine's first background
thread); `src/vector.rs`/`src/fulltext.rs` (new); `LogicalPlan::CreateIndex`
+ `Expr::Near`; `Catalog::set_column_index` (a primitive shared by both the
M2.b Rust API and M2.c's `CREATE INDEX`); `exec_select_near`'s
over-fetch-then-filter execution. See `MEMORY.md` for the full
module-by-module breakdown across all four checkpoints, including two
design corrections found and fixed during implementation (the
`instant-distance` incremental-insert assumption, and a rebuild-on-open gap
that would have silently dropped `FullText` indexes on reopen).

**Known limitations / tech debt (new in M2, on top of M1's carried-forward list):**
- `VectorIndex`/`InvertedIndex` never reclaim entries for rows superseded
  by UPDATE — the same shape of gap as M1's "no vacuum," just for the
  secondary index instead of the heap (correctness is unaffected; it's an
  unbounded space leak under update-heavy workloads on indexed columns).
- No SQL-level full-text query surface — `InvertedIndex::search` exists and
  is tested directly, but only `NEAR` (vector) has a `WHERE`-clause operator
  in M2's scope.
- `instant-distance`'s full-rebuild-per-upsert cost (see benchmark
  discussion above) means unidb's vector-index-active INSERT overhead will
  grow with dataset size in a way a true incremental HNSW would not —
  flagged for a future milestone to revisit if it becomes a real blocker.
