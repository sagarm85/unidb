## Current status

- **Milestone:** M1 and M2 are DONE. **M3 (graph) is underway — checkpoint
  M3.a (edge storage foundation) is complete.** The approved plan lives at
  `/Users/sagarmahamuni/.claude/plans/misty-hugging-brook.md` (four
  checkpoints, M3.a–d).
- **State:** 168 unit tests + 10 crash-harness tests + 3 `tests/
  index_rebuild.rs` tests + 1 `tests/vector_mvcc.rs` test (182 total) all
  green, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt
  --all --check` clean, release build succeeds. Graph edges are stored as
  ordinary rows in a synthetic `__edges__` system table (auto-created at
  `Engine::open()`), with a synchronous in-memory edge-list index
  (`from_id -> [RowId]`) rebuilt on every open. `Engine::create_edge`/
  `delete_edge`/`edges_from` round-trip correctly and `__edges__` is
  immediately ordinary-SQL-queryable with zero graph-specific code.
- **Immediate next task:** Checkpoint M3.b — per-edge locking verification
  (tests proving the existing `LockManager` already handles it correctly,
  no new code) and the batch-latch adjacency-scan optimization (already
  implemented in M3.a's `resolve_candidates_batched`, per the plan's
  "build this batched from the start" — M3.b's remaining work is the
  locking tests, the design note, and the before/after benchmark). See the
  plan file's Checkpoint M3.b.

### Design note: read-only transactions pay an unnecessary commit fsync (found in M1.d)

Running M1's benchmarks (`benches/load.rs`) turned up a real, previously
unnoticed inefficiency: point `SELECT` (a pure read, no writes at all) went
from 855ns in M0 to 3.05ms in M1 — a ~3,570x regression, far more than the
~2x expected from adding a transaction wrapper. Root cause:
`TransactionManager::commit()` unconditionally calls `wal.commit_user_txn()`,
which fsyncs, regardless of whether the transaction ever wrote anything. A
read-only transaction has nothing that needs to become durable, so this
fsync is pure waste — real databases (Postgres, SQLite) specifically avoid
writing WAL records for read-only transaction commits for exactly this
reason. **Not fixed in M1** (wasn't in the agreed scope, and fixing it
properly means checking `Transaction.undo_log.is_empty()` at commit time
and skipping `wal.commit_user_txn()`'s fsync — or the call entirely — when
true, which touches `txn.rs`'s commit path CLAUDE.md would want reviewed
rather than slipped in as a drive-by). Recorded in `PROGRESS.md`'s M1 entry
and flagged in Open questions below so it doesn't get lost before M2.

### Design note: no separate "commit-time recheck" needed for SI conflict detection (M1.b)

The plan called for two distinct conflict checks: an immediate lock-acquire-time
check, and a "commit-time first-committer-wins recheck" guarding the case where
the previous lock holder released via abort and something else slipped in
before this transaction's commit. Implemented `LockManager` (`lockmgr.rs`,
`RecordKind`/`RecordId` generic over future M2+ kinds, write-write only — no
read locks under MVCC) and wired `try_acquire_write` into `Heap::update`/
`delete` before the mini-txn begins. But because a lock is held for the
*entire* transaction lifetime (released only in `TransactionManager::commit`/
`abort`, never in between), no other transaction can successfully write to a
row this transaction touched until this one finishes — there is no race
window between "write" and "commit" for a separate recheck to catch in this
single-threaded engine. `Heap::update`/`delete` already run two checks that
together *are* the complete conflict detection: (1) `try_acquire_write`
catches another *currently active* xid (immediate abort, no waiting, D12);
(2) the existing `xmax != 0` check catches a row already superseded by a
transaction that has *since committed and released its lock* — a distinct
failure mode the lock table alone can't see once the holder is gone. Verified
by `lib.rs`'s `concurrent_update_aborts_second_writer_immediately`,
`commit_releases_lock_for_next_writer`, `abort_releases_lock_for_next_writer`.

### Design note: catalog is not MVCC-versioned; page-list tech debt fixed (M1.c)

Two deliberate scope calls made while building `catalog.rs`/the executor:

1. **Catalog rows are not MVCC-versioned.** DDL takes effect immediately and
   globally the moment `CREATE TABLE` returns — no snapshot isolation for
   schema, no rollback of a `CREATE TABLE` if the surrounding transaction
   later aborts. Building real snapshot-isolated DDL would require every SQL
   statement's catalog lookup to carry a snapshot and walk visibility,
   disproportionate to M1.c's actual goal (prove SQL works end-to-end). The
   catalog is persisted as a single `serde_json`-encoded blob rewritten to a
   fresh page on every change (`control.catalog_root` points at the latest
   one) — using `serde` here, unlike the rest of the on-disk format, is
   deliberate: schema metadata is infrequent control-plane data, not what
   D9's "no serde on the hot path" rule is protecting.
2. **Fixed a real latent bug while building table storage**: `Heap`'s page
   list was in-memory only (flagged as tech debt since M0/M1.a), meaning
   `scan()` would have silently returned nothing for a table's existing rows
   after every engine reopen. `TableDef.pages: Vec<PageId>` now persists
   each table's page list in the catalog, and `Heap::from_pages`/`page_ids()`
   let the executor reconstruct a working `Heap` handle each statement and
   detect growth to persist back. Verified by
   `executor::tests::table_survives_reopen_via_catalog_pages` and
   `tests::sql_survives_reopen`.

Also: there is no separate "physical plan" IR (`sql/physical.rs` from the
original plan was folded into `executor.rs`) — M1's grammar subset maps 1:1
from logical plan to execution step (single table, no joins), so a distinct
physical layer bound to schema would have been a premature abstraction for
this milestone; column-name resolution against `TableDef` happens directly
inside the executor instead.

RC's EvalPlanQual-style re-evaluation path (D12, sequenced after SI) is
**not implemented** — UPDATE/DELETE conflicts propagate as `WriteConflict`
regardless of isolation level. This is a tracked, documented gap (see
`sql/executor.rs`'s module doc), not a blocker for M1.c's "prove SQL works"
bar; it needs the executor's predicate evaluation to exist first, which it
now does, so it's ready to build whenever it becomes a real gap in practice.

### Design note: abort requires physical undo even in M1.a (not deferred to M1.b)

While implementing `txn.rs`, found that `mvcc::is_visible`'s snapshot check
(`is_committed_at_snapshot`: not-in-active-set-and-in-range ⇒ committed) has
no separate "aborted" concept — so a naive `TransactionManager::abort()` that
just flips txn state without reversing the tuple bytes would make an aborted
insert look committed to any snapshot taken after the abort. Fix: abort must
physically neutralize its own writes immediately, by self-stamping xmax on
any tuple it inserted (`xmax = its own xmin`, making it permanently
invisible — same code path as a normal delete-then-committed row) and
reverting any xmax stamp it applied back to 0. This reuses `is_visible`'s
existing committed/active distinction instead of adding a third state.
Implemented via `Heap::undo_insert`/`undo_xmax_stamp`, driven by an in-memory
`Vec<UndoAction>` on each `Transaction` (built up as `Heap` calls happen —
cheap, no WAL-decoding needed at runtime since the process is still alive).
Recovery's crash-time undo of an *incomplete* user transaction (no in-memory
state survives a crash) instead reconstructs ownership by decoding
`xmin`/xmax straight out of the WAL's redo bytes — see `recovery.rs`'s
two-phase pass (revert xmax-stamps first, then force-self-stamp inserts last,
so a row both inserted and re-superseded by the same aborted transaction
correctly ends up permanently dead rather than accidentally revived). This
same idempotent recovery pass is what makes crash-mid-abort safe too (P9,
`tests/crash/main.rs`): whether runtime abort never started, or crashed
partway through its own undo_log, recovery re-derives the same "incomplete
user txn" verdict from the WAL and re-applies the same idempotent undo.

### Design note: VECTOR(n) row encoding and parser plumbing (M2.a)

`ColumnType::Vector(u32)` carries a fixed dimension `n`, validated `> 0` at
both `CREATE TABLE` time (parser) and every INSERT/UPDATE (executor's
`coerce_value`/`decode_row`). Row encoding uses a new tag byte `5`:
`[dim:4 LE][f32 * dim, 4 bytes LE each]` — dimension-prefixed (not just
relying on the column's declared `n`) so `decode_row` can cross-check the
stored dimension against the schema and return a `DbError::SqlPlan` on
mismatch rather than silently misreading bytes or panicking. `f32`, not
`f64`: matches real embedding models' native precision and halves row size,
and matches `pgvector`/FAISS convention for the later Postgres+pgvector
benchmark comparison.

Parser plumbing required two `sqlparser` 0.62.0 specifics, both confirmed
against the vendored source before use (see plan file): `VECTOR(n)` has no
built-in AST type, so it arrives as `DataType::Custom(ObjectName,
Vec<String>)` — matched case-insensitively on the name, first modifier
parsed as `u32`. Bare `[0.1, 0.2, ...]` array literals parse unconditionally
under `GenericDialect` as `SqlExpr::Array`, unrelated to `VECTOR` — handled
by a new `convert_array_literal` that parses each element as `f32` (a
narrow fallback scoped to array-literal elements only; `convert_value`'s
general numeric path stays `i64`-only, unchanged).

Dimension validation is deliberately enforced in three independent places
(parser rejects `VECTOR(0)`; executor's `coerce_value` checks the literal's
length against the column at plan-execution time; `decode_row` re-checks on
every read) rather than trusting any single point — cheap, and each guards
a different failure mode (bad DDL, bad INSERT, corrupted/mismatched stored
bytes).

### Design note: instant-distance has no incremental insert — plan corrected (M2.b)

The approved M2 plan chose `instant-distance` partly on the assumption of
"native incremental insertion." That turned out to be wrong: checked against
the vendored 0.6.1 source, `Builder::build`/`Hnsw::new` only construct an
`HnswMap`/`Hnsw` from a full `Vec<P>`/`Vec<V>` at once — there is no public
method to add a single point to an already-built graph. Corrected design
(`src/vector.rs`): `VectorIndex` buffers every live point in a
`HashMap<RowId, Vec<f32>>` and rebuilds the whole HNSW graph from scratch on
every `upsert`/`remove`. This still satisfies CLAUDE.md's M2 goal ("row
write is the only synchronous cost") because the rebuild happens entirely on
the background worker thread — the foreground write path only ever sends a
channel message, same as the original plan intended. The tradeoff is
real, though: rebuild-per-upsert is O(n log n) per insert at the index
structure level, not O(log n) amortized the way true incremental HNSW
insertion would be. Not a correctness issue, and M2.d's benchmark table
(§6, "report honestly if it doesn't show negligible overhead") is exactly
where this gets evidence-based scrutiny rather than being assumed fine.
Distance metric: squared-root Euclidean (`pgvector`'s `<->` default), chosen
for the later benchmark comparison to be apples-to-apples.

### Design note: background worker never touches storage-layer types (M2.b)

`index_worker.rs`'s worker thread owns exactly one thing:
`Arc<RwLock<HashMap<(table, column), IndexEntry>>>`, built purely from
`IndexMsg` channel messages. It never receives a `BufferPool`, `Wal`, or
`Heap` handle — confirming the plan's core risk-mitigation choice held up
in practice. Two flows funnel through the *same* channel:
- **Rebuild-on-open**: `Engine::open` runs an ordinary begin/scan/commit
  read-only transaction (identical MVCC machinery to a `SELECT`) on the
  foreground thread, decodes each row via the existing `executor::decode_row`,
  and sends one `IndexMsg::Upsert` per row with a non-empty vector column,
  followed by one `IndexMsg::MarkReady` per indexed column once the scan
  finishes. This is what lets `IndexStatus` distinguish `Building` (worker
  still draining a backlog) from `Ready` (drained) — `MarkReady` is
  processed strictly after every `Upsert` sent before it, since it's the
  same FIFO channel.
- **Live upserts**: `sql/executor.rs`'s new `send_vector_upserts` runs once
  per inserted/updated row (not once globally), checking `ColumnDef.index`
  directly — zero cost for tables with no indexed column, satisfying "row
  write is the only synchronous cost."

**A new general catalog primitive was added ahead of its originally-planned
checkpoint**: `Catalog::set_column_index`/`Engine::set_column_index` (M2.b),
even though the plan placed "persist `ColumnDef.index`" under M2.c's
`CREATE INDEX` task. Justified narrowly: M2.b's own tests needed *some* way
to mark a column indexed to prove the worker pipeline end-to-end, and this
is exactly the catalog-persistence primitive M2.c's `CREATE INDEX` executor
code was always going to call internally (mirrors `set_rls_policy`'s
existing pattern) — M2.c only adds the SQL parsing, `LogicalPlan::CreateIndex`,
and immediate backfill-on-existing-rows on top of this, not a competing
mechanism. What M2.b's `set_column_index` deliberately does *not* do:
backfill already-committed rows immediately — an already-populated table
only gets indexed on the next `Engine::open`'s rebuild-on-open rescan.
`CREATE INDEX` (M2.c) will call `set_column_index` and *then* run its own
backfill scan, using the exact same rebuild logic factored out for reuse
(`send_vector_upserts_for_rebuild` in `lib.rs`).

**Known, accepted tech debt from this checkpoint** (parallel to M1's
"no vacuum" gap): `VectorIndex` has no removal-on-obsolescence path for
UPDATE. Since M1 UPDATE always creates a new `RowId` (never in-place), a
row's old vector value stays in the index forever, keyed by a `RowId` whose
tuple is now permanently dead. This is a correctness non-issue — a stale
candidate resolves to `NoVisibleVersion` at read time and gets filtered out,
exactly like MVCC's existing "no vacuum" story for the heap itself — but it
is an unbounded space leak under update-heavy workloads on indexed columns.
Tracked below, not silently dropped.

### Design note: CREATE INDEX's USING clause must precede the column list (M2.c)

`sqlparser` 0.62.0's `parse_create_index` only looks for an optional
`USING <type>` clause immediately after the table name — *before* the
`(column)` list, not after (confirmed by reading `parse_create_index`
directly, not guessed). So the SQL surface is
`CREATE INDEX idx ON t USING HNSW (embedding)`, not
`CREATE INDEX idx ON t (embedding) USING HNSW` (the latter is a
different, MySQL-specific trailing-options grammar path this project
doesn't hook into). `HNSW`/`FULLTEXT` arrive as `IndexType::Custom(Ident)`
since neither is a real SQL index type — matched case-insensitively, same
pattern as `VECTOR(n)`'s `DataType::Custom` fallback from M2.a.

### Design note: CREATE INDEX generalizes M2.b's rebuild/upsert plumbing, doesn't duplicate it (M2.c)

`exec_create_index` (`sql/executor.rs`) and `lib.rs`'s rebuild-on-open both
need the same "decode a row, pick out its indexed columns, build the right
`IndexedColumn` variant per column type" logic. Factored into one shared
function, `executor::build_indexed_columns`, so the
`ColumnType`/`IndexKind` → `IndexedColumn::{Vector,Text}` mapping exists in
exactly one place. `lib.rs`'s `rebuild_vector_indexes` was renamed
`rebuild_secondary_indexes` and generalized from "only scan `Hnsw` columns"
to "scan any indexed column" — necessary because a table with only a
`FullText` index would otherwise have silently lost its index on every
reopen (M2.b's version only ever looked for `Hnsw`). Caught and fixed in
the same pass as building `CREATE INDEX`, not left as a latent gap.

The one behavioral difference between the two entry points, by design:
`CREATE INDEX` (M2.c) backfills *immediately* (scans currently-committed
rows synchronously-enqueued, right there in the executor), while
`Engine::set_column_index` (M2.b's Rust-only API, kept for programmatic use)
still defers population to the next `Engine::open`'s rebuild. `CREATE
INDEX`'s validation (`IndexKind::Hnsw` only on `ColumnType::Vector`,
`IndexKind::FullText` only on `ColumnType::Text`) reuses the exact
`DbError::SqlPlan` error shape already established for vector-dimension
mismatches in M2.a — one consistent "bad plan for this schema" error
family, not a new one per feature.

### Design note: NEAR's over-fetch-then-filter execution and the MVCC re-check (M2.d)

`Expr::Near { column, query, k }` lives inside `Select.predicate: Option<Expr>`
— a predicate-shaped construct, not a new `LogicalPlan` variant — so
`apply_rls`'s existing AND-rewrite needed zero changes: `WHERE NEAR(...) AND
<rls policy>` composes for free, and `NEAR(...) OR x` is already rejected by
the existing AND-only `WHERE` grammar with no special case needed.

`exec_select` detects a top-level (or top-level-AND'd) `Near` via a small
`find_near` walk and dispatches to `exec_select_near`, which: (1) validates
the column actually has `IndexKind::Hnsw` on a `Vector` column — a clear
`DbError::SqlPlan`, not a silent full-scan fallback, for both "no index"
and "wrong index kind" cases; (2) takes a read lock on the worker's shared
`indexes` map and asks `VectorIndex::search` for `4x k` (or `k+20`,
whichever larger) candidates; (3) resolves each candidate `RowId` back to a
row via the *same* `Heap::get` + MVCC snapshot every other read path uses,
silently dropping any `NoVisibleVersion` result (superseded row, or a row
whose insert never committed); (4) runs the row through the *same*
`predicate_matches` a full scan uses, so any AND'd RLS/WHERE terms apply
identically. `eval_expr`'s `Expr::Near` arm always returns `true` when
re-evaluating a candidate that already came from the index — it does not
recompute distance — since proximity was already established by step 2;
that arm is *only* ever reached from this recheck path, never from a full
scan (which never dispatches into `exec_select_near` in the first place).

An index entry absent from the worker's map (e.g. `CREATE INDEX` just
enqueued its backfill and the worker hasn't processed the first message
yet) yields zero candidates, not an error — this is what
`IndexStatus::Building` is for. A genuinely bad `MarkReady` bug was found
and fixed in this pass: sending `MarkReady` for a column that had never
received a single `Upsert` (e.g. `CREATE INDEX` on an empty table) used to
silently no-op, since the handler only updated an *existing* map entry.
That left the column's status permanently stuck in `Building` once the
first live row finally arrived (its `Upsert` would create a fresh
`Building` entry that no later message ever flipped to `Ready`). Fixed by
having `MarkReady` carry the `IndexKind` and create an empty, already-`Ready`
entry if none exists — see `index_worker.rs`'s
`mark_ready_on_never_upserted_column_creates_ready_entry` regression test.

### Design note: no cross-statement RowId stability

Initially built `Heap::get` to walk the `prev_page`/`prev_slot` chain
backward looking for a visible version when the given `RowId` itself wasn't
visible. This doesn't work: the chain only points to *older* versions, so it
can never find a *newer* one, and two unit tests written against that
assumption failed for good reason. Removed the walk — `get` now does a
single direct visibility check against the exact given `RowId` and returns
`NoVisibleVersion` otherwise. This matches the M1 plan's explicit
simplification: **no stable row handles across statements**, even within the
same transaction that just updated the row. Callers (including the
transaction that just called `update`) must use the returned `RowId` or
re-scan, never reuse a pre-update one. `prev_page`/`prev_slot` still exists
and is populated — its purpose is version-history bookkeeping (recovery's
undo-ownership decoding, future vacuum), not reader traversal.

                        not yet re-run against M1's transactional API
```

Key design decisions confirmed in implementation (M0 + M1.a + M1.b + M1.c):
- D5 enforced: checked at `flush_page()` and in `find_victim()` eviction path only
- WAL uses length-prefix framing (u32 LE) + per-record CRC32; scan stops at corruption
- `mmap.rs` is the sole `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` module; rest of crate uses `#![deny]`
- All page/WAL integers are little-endian (D9); `FORMAT_VERSION` bumped 1→2 for the
  tuple header change (no migration path — M0 never shipped externally)
- Mini-txns (D2, per-statement) and user-txns (M1, multi-statement) are two
  independent ID spaces sharing one WAL wire format — `mini_txn_id`'s u64 slot
  doubles as the xid for `WAL_TXN_*` records
- `Heap::get`/`scan` do a single direct visibility check, no version-chain
  walk (see design note above — the chain only points backward, useless for
  finding a newer version; no cross-statement RowId stability by design)
- Abort/rollback works by physically self-stamping/reverting xmax, not by a
  separate "aborted" transaction-status check in the visibility path (see
  design note above)
- Locks are in-memory only, held for a transaction's full lifetime, released
  only at commit/abort — this is what makes a separate "commit-time recheck"
  unnecessary (see design note above)
- Catalog metadata uses `serde_json` (unlike per-row on-disk data, which is
  hand-rolled) — schema changes are infrequent control-plane operations, not
  the D9 "no serde" hot path; table rows themselves are hand-rolled tag+value
  encoded, which *is* the hot path (see design note above)
- Table storage (`Heap`) is reconstructed fresh per SQL statement from the
  catalog's persisted `TableDef.pages` list, not cached long-lived on `Engine`
  — cheap (just a `Vec<PageId>` clone) and avoids a cache-invalidation story
  for M1's scope

---

## In progress

Nothing — M2 milestone fully closed out (all four checkpoints verified,
benchmarked, committed). Ready to start M3 planning (graph).

---

## M1.a task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ Error variants (`error.rs`): `WriteConflict`, `SerializationFailure`,
   `TxnNotActive`, `TxnAlreadyFinished`, `NoVisibleVersion`, SQL/catalog
   placeholders for later checkpoints.
2. ✅ Tuple header 16→24 bytes + `FORMAT_VERSION` 1→2 (`page.rs`/`format.rs`).
3. ✅ Control file `catalog_root` field (`control.rs`).
4. ✅ WAL user-txn record types + `begin/commit/abort_user_txn` (`wal.rs`/`format.rs`).
5. ✅ MVCC visibility logic (`mvcc.rs`, new).
6. ✅ Transaction manager (`txn.rs`, new) — built together with heap rewrite
   (task 7) since they're tightly coupled; see design notes above.
7. ✅ Heap MVCC rewrite (`heap.rs`).
8. ✅ User-txn recovery undo pass (`recovery.rs`).
9. ✅ `on_read`/`on_write` seam (`concurrency_hooks.rs`, new), threaded
   through every `Heap` read/write path.
10. ✅ Crash tests P6/P7 (`tests/crash/main.rs`).
11. ✅ M1.a checkpoint verification: `Engine::begin/commit/abort` wired,
    71 unit tests + 8 crash tests green, clippy/fmt clean, release build OK.

**M1.a done when:** transactional `Engine::begin/commit/abort` works around
insert/get/update/delete ✅, RC vs RR visibility distinction verified by a
hand-written interleaved-transaction test ✅ (`repeatable_read_does_not_see_write_committed_after_begin`
in `lib.rs`), all tests green ✅.

## M1.b task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ Lock manager (`lockmgr.rs`, new): `RecordKind`/`RecordId`/`LockManager`,
   write-write only, no wait queue (D12).
2. ✅ Wired `try_acquire_write` into `Heap::update`/`delete`, before the
   mini-txn begins; `Engine`/`TransactionManager` now own/thread a
   `LockManager` alongside `pool`/`wal`/`heap`.
3. ✅ Investigated the planned "commit-time first-committer-wins recheck" and
   found it subsumed by lock-held-until-commit — documented as a design note
   rather than building redundant code; verified with 3 hand-written
   interleaved-transaction tests in `lib.rs`.
4. ✅ Crash test P9 (`tests/crash/main.rs`): crash mid-undo of an
   already-aborting transaction; recovery converges to fully-undone via the
   same idempotent pass built in M1.a task 8.
5. ✅ M1.b checkpoint verification: 80 unit tests + 9 crash tests green,
   clippy/fmt clean, release build OK.

**M1.b done when:** SI's abort-on-conflict path works end-to-end (a second
concurrent writer aborts immediately, no blocking) ✅, locks correctly
release on both commit and abort so a later writer can proceed ✅, crash
safety extended to the new abort/undo machinery (P9) ✅, all tests green ✅.

## M1.c task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ Catalog (`catalog.rs`, new): `ColumnDef`/`ColumnType`/`TableDef`/
   `Catalog`, `CatalogCtx` bundling persistence dependencies (clippy
   too-many-arguments), heap-backed-in-spirit but actually a single
   `serde_json` blob per change (simpler than reusing `Heap`'s MVCC path,
   which would've needed a "not MVCC-versioned" escape hatch anyway).
2. ✅ Added `sqlparser` (0.62.0) + `serde_json` + `serde` (with `derive`) to
   `Cargo.toml` via `cargo add`.
3. ✅ SQL parser (`sql/parser.rs`, new): wraps `sqlparser::Parser` with
   `GenericDialect`, converts its AST to `LogicalPlan`. Grammar subset:
   CREATE TABLE, INSERT (with/without column list), SELECT (star or named
   projection, AND-only WHERE), UPDATE, DELETE. Discovered `->`/`->>` bind
   *looser* than `=` under `GenericDialect`'s precedence table — the
   opposite of the initial assumption — so `data -> 'k' = 'v'` parses as
   `data -> ('k' = 'v')`; explicit parens required (documented in test
   comments and the module's own scope, not a bug to fix — SQL operator
   precedence is a dialect detail, not something to special-case).
4. ✅ Logical plan + RLS rewrite (`sql/logical.rs`, new): `LogicalPlan`/
   `Expr`/`Literal`/`CmpOp`, `apply_rls` (the entire RLS story, one
   AND-rewrite function).
5. ✅ JSON column type (already added to `catalog.rs` in task 1) +
   `Expr::JsonExtract`/`JsonExtractText` (`->`/`->>`) — parsed in task 3,
   evaluated in task 6's executor via `serde_json::Value` navigation.
6. ✅ Executor (`sql/executor.rs`, new) — no separate physical-plan IR (see
   design note above); row-at-a-time; hand-rolled row encoding; fixed a
   real latent bug in the same pass (`Heap` page-list persistence, see
   design note above).
7. ✅ Wired `Engine::execute_sql`/`set_rls_policy`; `Engine` now owns a
   `Catalog`, loaded via `Catalog::load` on every `open()`.
8. ✅ M1.c checkpoint verification: 112 unit tests + 9 crash tests green,
   clippy/fmt clean, release build OK.

**M1.c done when:** `CREATE TABLE` → `INSERT` → `SELECT ... WHERE` →
`UPDATE ... WHERE` → re-`SELECT` → `DELETE ... WHERE` → re-`SELECT`
round-trips correctly through the SQL API ✅ (`execute_sql_full_round_trip`
in `lib.rs`), including a JSON column with `->`/`->>` ✅
(`json_column_round_trip_and_extract` in `sql/executor.rs`), RLS filters
rows end-to-end ✅ (`rls_policy_filters_rows` in `lib.rs`), data survives
reopen via the catalog's persisted page list ✅ (`sql_survives_reopen`), all
tests green ✅.

## M1.d task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ Combined crash+MVCC property test (`tests/crash/main.rs`, new): a
   self-contained LCG (no new dependency) drives random `BEGIN`/`INSERT`/
   `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` sequences across 6 seeds, crashing (just stopping)
   at a random point — sometimes mid-transaction with no commit/abort call
   at all, sometimes right after one finishes. Added `Hash` to `RowId`'s
   derive to track expected rows in a `Vec`. Passed on the first run.
2. ✅ Extended `benches/load.rs` with a `contention` benchmark group:
   interleaved transactions racing for one row, second aborts immediately
   (D12) and retries — measures the real cost of SI's conflict path, not
   just uncontended CRUD.
3. ✅ Ran the full benchmark suite (`--sample-size 10`, reduced from the
   default 100 to keep wall-clock reasonable given fsync-dominated cost)
   and recorded M1's metrics table in `PROGRESS.md`, including an M0
   comparison. **Found a real bug in the process** — see the read-only-txn
   fsync design note above — rather than just reporting the raw numbers.
4. ✅ M1.d checkpoint verification: 112 unit tests + 10 crash tests (P1–P9
   plus the new property test) green, clippy/fmt clean, release build OK.

**M1.d done when:** the combined crash+MVCC property test passes ✅, M1's
benchmark table is recorded with an honest M0 comparison ✅ (including
reporting, not hiding, the read-only-txn regression found along the way),
all tests green ✅ — closing out the M1 milestone as a whole.

## M2.a task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ `ColumnType::Vector(u32)` + `IndexKind{Hnsw,FullText}` +
   `ColumnDef.index: Option<IndexKind>` (`catalog.rs`). Mechanical fix-up of
   every existing `ColumnDef` literal across `catalog.rs`/`sql/*.rs` tests
   to add the new field.
2. ✅ Vector row encoding tag 5 (`sql/executor.rs`): `coerce_value`,
   `encode_row`, `decode_row` all handle `Literal::Vector`/
   `ColumnType::Vector(n)`, dimension-checked, no panics.
3. ✅ `Literal::Vector(Vec<f32>)` (`sql/logical.rs`).
4. ✅ Parser support (`sql/parser.rs`): `VECTOR(n)` via `DataType::Custom`
   fallback, `[..]` array literals via `SqlExpr::Array` → `f32` elements.
5. ✅ M2.a checkpoint verification: end-to-end SQL round-trip
   (`execute_sql_vector_round_trip`, `execute_sql_vector_dimension_mismatch_rejected`
   in `lib.rs`) plus parser/executor unit tests; 121 unit tests + 10 crash
   tests green, clippy/fmt clean.

**M2.a done when:** `CREATE TABLE t (id INT, embedding VECTOR(4))` →
`INSERT ... VALUES (1, [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])` → `SELECT` round-trips
correctly through the actual SQL layer ✅, dimension mismatches rejected
with a clear `DbError::SqlPlan` ✅, all tests green ✅. No index/worker yet
— that's M2.b.

## M2.b task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ `src/vector.rs` (new): `VectorIndex` wrapper around `instant-distance`.
   Corrected the plan's "native incremental insertion" assumption after
   checking the vendored source (see design note above) — buffers points,
   rebuilds the HNSW graph on every `upsert`/`remove`.
2. ✅ `src/index_worker.rs` (new): the engine's first background thread.
   `IndexMsg{Upsert,MarkReady,Shutdown}`, `IndexedColumn::Vector`,
   `SecondaryIndex::Vector` (only variant so far — `FullText` lands in
   M2.c), `IndexStatus{Building{rows_done},Ready}`, `IndexHandle` with a
   bounded (5s) `shutdown()`. Worker owns only
   `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<(table,column), IndexEntry>>>`, never
   `BufferPool`/`Wal`/`Heap`.
3. ✅ Rebuild-on-open (`lib.rs::rebuild_vector_indexes`): runs on the
   foreground thread via an ordinary begin/scan/commit read-only
   transaction (same MVCC path as `SELECT`), pipes results through the same
   channel live upserts use.
4. ✅ Live upserts (`sql/executor.rs::send_vector_upserts`): checked once
   per inserted/updated row via `ColumnDef.index`, zero cost for
   non-indexed tables.
5. ✅ `Arc<RwLock<>>` shared index access — built directly into
   `index_worker.rs`'s `SharedIndexes` type from the start (not a
   follow-up), ready for M2.d's `NEAR` queries to take a read lock.
6. ✅ `Engine` gains an `index_worker: IndexHandle` field + `Drop` impl
   calling `shutdown()`.
7. ✅ Added `Catalog::set_column_index`/`Engine::set_column_index` ahead of
   its originally-planned M2.c slot, narrowly justified as the same
   primitive `CREATE INDEX` will call internally (see design note above) —
   needed now so M2.b's own tests could prove the worker pipeline
   end-to-end without waiting for the full `CREATE INDEX` SQL surface.
8. ✅ Tests: `index_worker.rs`'s own unit tests (send/status/shutdown in
   isolation) + three `lib.rs` integration tests exercising the real
   `Engine`: live-insert-enqueues-upsert, reopen-rebuilds-from-committed-rows,
   and drop-doesn't-hang.
9. ✅ M2.b checkpoint verification: 131 unit tests + 10 crash tests green,
   clippy/fmt clean, release build OK.

**M2.b done when:** the worker spawns on `Engine::open` ✅, correctly
rebuilds a `VectorIndex` from committed rows ✅
(`reopen_rebuilds_index_from_committed_rows`), live inserts/updates enqueue
upsert messages ✅ (`live_insert_into_indexed_column_enqueues_upsert`),
shutdown is clean and tested ✅ (`engine_drop_shuts_down_worker_without_hanging`),
`IndexStatus` reports `Building`/`Ready` correctly ✅, all tests green ✅.

## M2.c task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ `src/fulltext.rs` (new): `InvertedIndex` — whitespace+lowercase
   tokenization, `HashMap<String, Vec<RowId>>` postings, AND-only
   multi-term intersection search, `upsert`/`remove` mirroring
   `VectorIndex`'s API shape.
2. ✅ Generalized `index_worker.rs`: `SecondaryIndex::FullText(InvertedIndex)`,
   `IndexedColumn::Text{column,data}`, extended `worker_loop`'s match arm —
   confirmed the message/status plumbing needed zero shape changes, exactly
   as M2.b's design note predicted.
3. ✅ `LogicalPlan::CreateIndex{table,column,kind}` (`sql/logical.rs`) +
   parser support (`sql/parser.rs`) for `CREATE INDEX ... ON t USING
   HNSW|FULLTEXT (column)`. Found and documented a real grammar detail:
   `USING` must precede the column list, not follow it (see design note
   above) — caught before shipping broken tests, not after.
4. ✅ `exec_create_index` (`sql/executor.rs`): validates column-type
   compatibility, persists via `Catalog::set_column_index` (built ahead of
   schedule in M2.b), immediately backfills every committed row through the
   worker channel, sends `MarkReady`. Factored `build_indexed_columns` out
   as the one shared column-type-to-`IndexedColumn` mapping, used by both
   live upserts and every backfill path.
5. ✅ **Found and fixed a latent gap while building this**: `lib.rs`'s
   rebuild-on-open only ever scanned `IndexKind::Hnsw` columns — a
   `FullText`-indexed table would have silently lost its index on every
   reopen. Generalized (`rebuild_vector_indexes` → `rebuild_secondary_indexes`)
   to scan any indexed column, using the same shared `build_indexed_columns`
   helper from task 4.
6. ✅ Tests: executor-level validation (rejects `Hnsw` on `Text`, rejects
   `FullText` on `Vector`, rejects unknown column, persists correctly for
   both valid combinations) + two `lib.rs` integration tests through the
   real `Engine`: immediate-backfill-and-queryable, and
   type-mismatch-rejected-via-SQL.
7. ✅ M2.c checkpoint verification: 148 unit tests + 10 crash tests green,
   clippy/fmt clean, release build OK.

**M2.c done when:** `CREATE INDEX ... USING FULLTEXT` builds and maintains
an `InvertedIndex` via the shared worker ✅, term search returns correct
intersections ✅, tokenization tests pass ✅, `CREATE INDEX` validation
rejects type-kind mismatches ✅, all tests green ✅.

## M2.d task breakdown (ordered — all complete)

1. ✅ `Expr::Near{column,query,k}` (`sql/logical.rs`) + parser support
   (`sql/parser.rs`): `NEAR(...)` parses unmodified as `SqlExpr::Function`,
   confirmed against `sqlparser`'s AST before writing the conversion code.
2. ✅ `exec_select_near` (`sql/executor.rs`): over-fetch-then-filter
   execution — validates the column is `Hnsw`-indexed on a `Vector` column,
   over-fetches from `VectorIndex::search`, resolves candidates via
   `Heap::get` + the ordinary MVCC snapshot, re-runs the full predicate
   through `predicate_matches`. `eval_expr`'s new `Expr::Near` arm always
   returns `true` on recheck (proximity already established).
3. ✅ **Found and fixed a real bug while wiring this up**: `MarkReady` on a
   column that had never received an `Upsert` (e.g. `CREATE INDEX` on an
   empty table) silently no-opped, permanently stranding the column in
   `Building` once a later live insert finally arrived. Fixed by having
   `MarkReady` carry `IndexKind` and create an already-`Ready` empty entry
   when none exists yet — caught by two failing `lib.rs` NEAR tests before
   it could ship, then covered by a dedicated regression test in
   `index_worker.rs`.
4. ✅ `tests/index_rebuild.rs` (new): engine-restart rebuild correctness for
   both index kinds, `NEAR`-while-`Building` returns a valid (possibly
   partial) result set without erroring.
5. ✅ `tests/vector_mvcc.rs` (new) — **the single most important test in
   M2**: inserts a row, deterministically polls (via the inserting
   transaction's own self-visible `NEAR` query, not a timing guess) until
   the worker has demonstrably indexed it, aborts instead of committing,
   then proves a fresh transaction's `NEAR` query never returns that row.
6. ✅ `benches/vector.rs` (new) + a real, no-mocking Postgres 18 + pgvector
   0.8.4 comparison run locally (`brew install pgvector`, isolated
   `unidb_bench` database, dropped after recording numbers). Recorded
   honestly in `PROGRESS.md`, including where unidb is far behind and why
   (pre-existing per-statement fsync cost from M1, `instant-distance`'s
   full-rebuild-per-upsert cost) — not flattered.
7. ✅ M2.d / M2 milestone checkpoint verification: 158 unit + 10 crash + 3
   `index_rebuild` + 1 `vector_mvcc` tests (172 total) green, clippy/fmt
   clean, release build OK.

**M2.d done when:** `SELECT ... WHERE NEAR(col, [...], k)` returns
MVCC-correct, RLS-respecting results end-to-end ✅; the rollback-correctness
test passes ✅; rebuild-after-restart and mid-rebuild-staleness tests pass
✅; M2's benchmark table is recorded with the Postgres+pgvector comparison
✅; all tests green ✅ — closing out the M2 milestone as a whole.

## Open questions / pending human input

- **Decide: fix the read-only-transaction fsync now, or carry it into M2?**
  (See the design note above and `PROGRESS.md`'s M1 entry.) It's a small,
  well-understood fix (skip `wal.commit_user_txn()`'s fsync in
  `TransactionManager::commit` when `Transaction.undo_log.is_empty()`), but
  touches the commit path CLAUDE.md's conventions would want treated as a
  deliberate change, not a drive-by — hence surfacing it here rather than
  just fixing it.
- **Decide: is catalog DDL's lack of transactionality acceptable to carry
  into M2, or does it need addressing first?** (See below.)
- Deferred-but-flagged for later milestones: slow-consumer-vs-vacuum durability
  contract (M4); filtered-HNSW vs over-fetch for RLS on `NEAR` (M2); SSI
  activation (post-M1, seam built in M1.a per D11, still all no-ops — M1.b's
  lock manager has no wait queue/deadlock detection, deliberately deferred to
  that future SSI effort).
- RC's EvalPlanQual-style re-evaluation path (D12, sequenced after SI) is
  designed but **still not implemented** even though M1.c's executor now
  exists (the thing it was waiting on) — UPDATE/DELETE conflicts propagate
  as `WriteConflict` regardless of isolation level. Not a blocker for M1's
  stated "prove SQL works" bar; flagged for whenever this becomes a real
  correctness gap in practice, since it's now unblocked and buildable.
- Catalog DDL is not MVCC-versioned/transactional (see design note above) —
  a `CREATE TABLE` inside a transaction that later aborts is **not** rolled
  back. This is a real, if narrow, correctness gap relative to "DDL is
  naturally transactional" from the original plan; flagged, not silently
  dropped.

---

## Known issues / tech debt

- **Read-only transactions pay a full commit fsync for nothing** (found in
  M1.d's benchmark pass — see design note above). ~3,570x regression on
  point SELECT vs. M0, isolated entirely to this one unnecessary fsync.
  Straightforward fix identified, not applied — see Open questions above.
- FSM is a linear scan over all heap pages — fine for M0/M1, revisit if insert
  throughput regresses.
- WAL truncation rewrites the entire file — acceptable for now, needs a proper
  log-segment scheme in later milestones.
- **No vacuum/GC in M1.** Dead tuple versions (`xmax` set, no snapshot can see
  them, or self-stamped-dead by an abort) are never reclaimed. Heap pages only
  grow. Safe (no correctness issue) but a real throughput/storage regression
  for update-heavy workloads — tracked for a post-M1 vacuum milestone. This
  compounds with the FSM linear-scan tech debt above (dead tuples reduce
  effective free space per page). Catalog pages have the exact same
  accumulate-garbage-on-rewrite property (M1.c) — every `CREATE TABLE`/RLS
  policy change leaves the previous catalog blob's page behind.
- **INSERT/UPDATE are ~2x slower than M0** when each statement is its own
  transaction (the worst case — see `PROGRESS.md`'s M1 entry for why this is
  expected and how batching multiple statements per transaction amortizes
  it away). Not a bug, but worth remembering when reading raw throughput
  numbers out of context.
- **No wait queue / deadlock detection in `LockManager`** (M1.b) — deliberate
  per D12, since SI's conflict handling is "abort immediately," not
  "block and wait." A future SERIALIZABLE/SSI effort would need to add this,
  which is exactly what the D11 seam exists to make possible without a
  lock-manager rewrite.
- **RC's EvalPlanQual re-evaluation path is unimplemented** (see Open
  questions above) — tracked, not silently dropped.
- **Catalog DDL is not transactional** (see Open questions above) — tracked,
  not silently dropped.
- SQL grammar gaps, all deliberate per the agreed M1 scope: no joins, no
  aggregates, no subqueries, no `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`, `WHERE` is AND-only (no
  `OR`), no `@>` JSON containment, no binary JSONB storage, no JSON index.
- **`instant-distance` has no incremental insert** (see M2.b design note
  above) — `VectorIndex` rebuilds the whole HNSW graph from scratch on
  every `upsert`/`remove`, O(n log n) per insert rather than the O(log n)
  amortized a true incremental HNSW would give. Not a correctness issue;
  flagged for M2.d's benchmark table to quantify honestly at realistic row
  counts, since CLAUDE.md's §6 explicitly wants this evidence-based rather
  than assumed fine.
- **No vector-index cleanup on UPDATE** (see M2.b design note above) — a
  row's old vector value stays indexed forever under its now-dead `RowId`
  after an UPDATE (which always creates a new `RowId` in M1's MVCC design).
  Correctness is unaffected (stale candidates resolve to `NoVisibleVersion`
  and get filtered at read time), but it's an unbounded space leak under
  update-heavy workloads on indexed columns — the same shape of gap as M1's
  "no vacuum" tech debt, just for the secondary index instead of the heap.
  The same applies to `InvertedIndex` (M2.c) for the identical reason.
- **No full-text query SQL surface** — `InvertedIndex::search` exists and
  is tested directly, but there's no SQL-level way to call it; only `NEAR`
  (vector) has a `WHERE`-clause operator in M2's scope. Not a bug — flagged
  so it isn't mistaken for an oversight later.
- **`instant-distance`'s full-rebuild-per-upsert cost is measurable, not
  just theoretical** (see M2.d's benchmark table in `PROGRESS.md`):
  vector-index-active INSERT throughput was ~2.8x slower than without an
  index at just 200 rows in this milestone's benchmark. Not a correctness
  issue, and still off the foreground's *blocking* path (the mechanism is
  CPU contention between the foreground and worker threads, not a
  synchronous wait) — but real enough that "row write is the only
  synchronous cost" needs the asterisk "...but the worker's own cost isn't
  free, and it scales worse than a true incremental HNSW would." Flagged
  for a future milestone to revisit if it becomes a real blocker.

## Session log (append newest at top; use the real current date)

### 2026-07-06 — M2.d complete; M2 milestone DONE

- Implemented all of M2.d: `Expr::Near` + parser support (zero grammar
  changes needed — `NEAR(...)` parses as an ordinary `SqlExpr::Function`),
  `exec_select_near`'s over-fetch-then-filter execution, `tests/
  index_rebuild.rs`, `tests/vector_mvcc.rs`, `benches/vector.rs`.
- **Found and fixed a real bug while wiring up `NEAR`, caught by the
  benchmark/integration tests themselves failing, not by inspection**:
  `MarkReady` on a column that had never received a single `Upsert` (the
  common case — `CREATE INDEX` on a table, then insert afterward) used to
  silently no-op, permanently stranding the index in `Building`. Root
  cause: the handler only updated an *existing* map entry; `Upsert`-driven
  entry creation always starts `Building` and nothing ever flipped a
  never-backfilled column to `Ready`. Fixed by giving `MarkReady` the
  `IndexKind` it needs to create an already-`Ready` empty entry.
- Ran the M2.d plan's explicitly-called-out "single most important test in
  M2": `tests/vector_mvcc.rs`'s aborted-insert test, using a deterministic
  poll-until-confirmed pattern (the inserting transaction's own
  self-visible `NEAR` query) rather than a timing-dependent sleep, per the
  plan's own caution against exactly that kind of flakiness.
- **Ran a real, non-mocked Postgres + pgvector benchmark**, not an
  estimate: `brew install pgvector` locally, an isolated `unidb_bench`
  database (dropped after recording numbers, no artifacts left behind),
  matching INSERT/`NEAR`-equivalent methodology against unidb's own
  `benches/vector.rs`. Recorded honestly in `PROGRESS.md`: unidb is far
  behind pgvector in absolute terms, and the writeup explains why (M1's
  already-known per-statement fsync cost, plus `instant-distance`'s
  full-rebuild-per-upsert cost measurably showing up even at 200 rows) —
  not flattered, per CLAUDE.md §6.
- **Final state:** 158 unit tests + 10 crash-harness tests + 3
  `index_rebuild` tests + 1 `vector_mvcc` test (172 total) green, `cargo
  clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --all --check`
  clean, `cargo build --release` succeeds.
- **M2 milestone is DONE.** All four checkpoints (M2.a/b/c/d) complete,
  benchmarked, and committed. Two design corrections were found and fixed
  during implementation rather than silently worked around: the
  `instant-distance` incremental-insert assumption (M2.b) and this
  session's `MarkReady` bug (M2.d) — both documented as design notes, not
  swept under the rug.
- **Next:** M3 planning (graph) has not started — this session ended with
  M2 fully closed out, no M3 work begun.

### 2026-07-06 — M2.c checkpoint complete (full-text index + CREATE INDEX)

- Implemented all of M2.c per the approved plan
  (`/Users/sagarmahamuni/.claude/plans/misty-hugging-brook.md`): `src/fulltext.rs`
  (`InvertedIndex`), generalized `index_worker.rs` to a `FullText` variant,
  `LogicalPlan::CreateIndex` + parser support, `exec_create_index` in
  `sql/executor.rs` with immediate backfill.
- **One real grammar detail found and documented, not guessed**: `sqlparser`
  0.62.0's `CREATE INDEX` only recognizes `USING <type>` *before* the
  column list, not after — the initial test SQL (`... (col) USING HNSW`)
  failed with `using: None` until read directly from `parse_create_index`'s
  source and corrected to `... USING HNSW (col)`.
- **One real latent gap found and fixed while building this, not left
  behind**: M2.b's rebuild-on-open only ever scanned `IndexKind::Hnsw`
  columns, so a `FullText`-indexed table would have silently lost its index
  on every engine reopen. Generalized the rebuild function
  (`rebuild_vector_indexes` → `rebuild_secondary_indexes`) to scan any
  indexed column, sharing the same `build_indexed_columns` helper newly
  factored out of the executor for exactly this purpose.
- Confirmed by design, not by accident: `CREATE INDEX` backfills
  immediately (scans and enqueues right there in the executor), while
  M2.b's `Engine::set_column_index` Rust API still only populates on next
  reopen — two different entry points with two different eagerness
  contracts, both intentional and both documented.
- **Final state:** 148 unit tests + 10 crash-harness tests green, `cargo
  clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --all --check`
  clean, `cargo build --release` succeeds.
- **Next:** M2.d — `NEAR` operator (`Expr::Near`, over-fetch-then-filter in
  `exec_select`), `tests/index_rebuild.rs` and `tests/vector_mvcc.rs` (the
  MVCC-rollback-correctness test — the single most important test in M2 per
  the plan), benchmarks with the Postgres+pgvector comparison, M2 milestone
  closeout in `PROGRESS.md`.

### 2026-07-06 — M2.b checkpoint complete (background indexing worker)

- Implemented all of M2.b per the approved plan
  (`/Users/sagarmahamuni/.claude/plans/misty-hugging-brook.md`): `src/vector.rs`
  (`VectorIndex` wrapping `instant-distance`), `src/index_worker.rs` (the
  engine's first background thread), rebuild-on-open + live-upsert wiring
  through `lib.rs`/`sql/executor.rs`, `Engine`'s `Drop` impl.
- **One real design correction found and fixed, not silently absorbed**:
  the plan assumed `instant-distance` supports native incremental insertion.
  Checked against the vendored 0.6.1 source before writing any code against
  it — it doesn't; `Builder::build` only does full-rebuild construction.
  Corrected `VectorIndex` to buffer points and rebuild the whole graph per
  upsert, documented as a design note and a tracked tech-debt item (M2.d's
  benchmark table is where this gets quantified honestly, not assumed away).
- Pulled one small primitive (`Catalog::set_column_index`/
  `Engine::set_column_index`) forward from its originally-planned M2.c slot,
  narrowly justified: M2.b's own tests needed a way to mark a column
  indexed to prove the worker pipeline end-to-end, and this is exactly the
  catalog-persistence call `CREATE INDEX` was always going to make
  internally — not a competing mechanism, and it deliberately does *not*
  backfill (that's still M2.c's job).
- Confirmed the plan's core risk-mitigation choice held up in practice: the
  worker thread's only state is `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<(table,column),
  IndexEntry>>>`, built purely from channel messages — it never received a
  `BufferPool`/`Wal`/`Heap` handle anywhere in the implementation.
- Flagged one new tech-debt item, parallel to M1's "no vacuum" gap: no
  index cleanup on UPDATE (old vector values under dead `RowId`s
  accumulate forever) — a space leak, not a correctness bug, since stale
  candidates resolve to `NoVisibleVersion` at read time.
- **Final state:** 131 unit tests + 10 crash-harness tests green, `cargo
  clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --all --check`
  clean, `cargo build --release` succeeds.
- **Next:** M2.c — full-text index (`src/fulltext.rs`) + explicit
  `CREATE INDEX ... USING HNSW|FULLTEXT` SQL surface, generalizing the
  worker's `SecondaryIndex` enum to a second variant and reusing
  `set_column_index` from the executor side this time.

### 2026-07-06 — M2.a checkpoint complete (VECTOR(n) foundation)

- Implemented all of M2.a per the approved plan
  (`/Users/sagarmahamuni/.claude/plans/misty-hugging-brook.md`):
  `ColumnType::Vector(u32)` + `IndexKind` in `catalog.rs`; row encoding tag
  5 (`[dim:4 LE][f32*dim]`) in `sql/executor.rs`'s `coerce_value`/
  `encode_row`/`decode_row`; `Literal::Vector(Vec<f32>)` in
  `sql/logical.rs`; parser support for `VECTOR(n)` (via `DataType::Custom`)
  and `[..]` array literals (via `SqlExpr::Array`) in `sql/parser.rs`.
- No design deviations from the plan — both `sqlparser` internals
  (`DataType::Custom` fallback, unconditional `SqlExpr::Array` parsing under
  `GenericDialect`) were confirmed against the vendored 0.62.0 source ahead
  of time in the plan, and held up exactly as expected during
  implementation.
- Dimension validation is deliberately redundant across three layers
  (parser rejects `n=0`, executor's `coerce_value` checks INSERT/UPDATE
  literals, `decode_row` re-checks stored bytes on every read) — see design
  note above for why each guards a distinct failure mode.
- Added end-to-end SQL-level tests (`execute_sql_vector_round_trip`,
  `execute_sql_vector_dimension_mismatch_rejected` in `lib.rs`) on top of
  the parser/executor unit tests, confirming the feature works through the
  real `Engine::execute_sql` path, not just in isolated unit tests.
- **Final state:** 121 unit tests + 10 crash-harness tests green, `cargo
  clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --all --check`
  clean.
- **Next:** M2.b — the background indexing worker (`src/index_worker.rs`,
  `src/vector.rs` wrapping `instant-distance`). This is M2's highest-risk
  checkpoint: the engine's first background thread, which must never touch
  `BufferPool`/`Wal`/`Heap`. See the plan file's tasks 6–12.

### 2026-07-06 — M1.d complete; M1 milestone DONE

- Added the combined crash+MVCC property test (`tests/crash/main.rs`): a
  small self-contained LCG (deliberately not a new `rand` dependency, since
  this is test-only and reproducibility just needs a fixed seed) drives
  random transaction sequences across 6 seeds with random crash points,
  including true mid-transaction crashes (no commit/abort call at all).
  Passed first try — no bugs found by this specific test, a genuine "the
  invariant holds" result, not just "test not written yet."
- Extended `benches/load.rs` with a `contention` benchmark group measuring
  SI's abort-on-conflict + retry cost, not just uncontended CRUD.
- Ran the full M1 benchmark suite (`--sample-size 10`, not the default 100,
  since each sample involves real fsyncs and the default would have taken
  well over an hour based on M0's timing) and recorded the table in
  `PROGRESS.md`.
- **Found a real, previously-unnoticed bug while benchmarking, not a
  pre-planned test**: point `SELECT`'s cost went from 855ns (M0) to 3.05ms
  (M1) — far more than the ~2x expected from transaction-wrapper overhead.
  Root cause: `TransactionManager::commit()` fsyncs unconditionally, even
  for read-only transactions that wrote nothing. Documented as a design
  note, recorded in `PROGRESS.md`, and left as an open question for
  deliberate fix-now-vs-defer decision rather than silently patched in
  passing — this touches a path CLAUDE.md's own conventions would want
  reviewed as a real change, not folded into an unrelated commit.
- INSERT/UPDATE landed at ~2x M0's cost, exactly as expected (each
  single-statement-per-transaction op now pays both the existing
  per-statement mini-txn fsync and a new per-transaction commit fsync) —
  confirmed this is inherent to the benchmark's "worst case: no batching"
  design, not a surprise regression.
- **Final state:** 112 unit tests + 10 crash-harness tests (P1–P9 + the
  new property test) green, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean, `cargo fmt --all --check` clean, `cargo build --release` succeeds.
- **M1 milestone is DONE.** All four checkpoints (M1.a/b/c/d) complete,
  benchmarked, and committed. Two open, human-decidable items carried
  forward rather than resolved unilaterally: the read-only-txn fsync fix,
  and whether catalog DDL needs transactionality before M2.
- **Next:** M2 planning (vector search) has not started — this session
  ended with M1 fully closed out, no M2 work begun.

### 2026-07-06 — M1.c checkpoint complete (catalog + SQL subset)

- Implemented all of M1.c: `catalog.rs` (schema + page-list persistence,
  `serde_json`-encoded, not MVCC-versioned), `sql/logical.rs` (LogicalPlan/
  Expr + `apply_rls`), `sql/parser.rs` (wraps `sqlparser` 0.62.0), `sql/
  executor.rs` (row-at-a-time execution, hand-rolled row encoding, no
  separate physical-plan IR), `Engine::execute_sql`/`set_rls_policy`.
- Fixed a real pre-existing bug while building table storage: `Heap`'s
  in-memory-only page list (flagged as tech debt since M0) would have made
  `scan()` silently return nothing for existing rows after every reopen.
  Now persisted via `TableDef.pages` in the catalog; `Heap::from_pages`/
  `page_ids()` let the executor reconstruct/detect-growth per statement.
- Discovered and worked around a `sqlparser` `GenericDialect` precedence
  surprise: `->`/`->>` bind looser than `=`, opposite of the initial
  assumption — documented, not treated as a bug.
- Two scope simplifications made and explicitly flagged rather than silently
  dropped: catalog DDL is not transactional/MVCC-versioned; RC's
  EvalPlanQual re-evaluation path remains unimplemented even though it's now
  unblocked (both noted in Open questions above for future work).
- **Final state:** 112 unit tests + 9 crash-harness tests (P1–P9) green,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --all --check`
  clean, `cargo build --release` succeeds.
- **Next:** M1.d — combined crash+MVCC property test, extend
  `benches/load.rs`, fill in M1's benchmark table, close out the milestone.

### 2026-07-06 — M1.b checkpoint complete (SI abort-on-conflict)

- Implemented all of M1.b: `lockmgr.rs` (write-write conflict tracking, no
  wait queue per D12), wired into `Heap::update`/`delete`, `Engine`/
  `TransactionManager` now own and thread a `LockManager` alongside
  `pool`/`wal`/`heap`, crash test P9 (crash mid-undo of an already-aborting
  transaction).
- One planned mechanism turned out to be unnecessary: the "commit-time
  first-committer-wins recheck" is subsumed by holding locks for a
  transaction's entire lifetime (released only at commit/abort) — analyzed
  and documented as a design note rather than building redundant code that
  would never actually fire in this single-threaded engine.
- Added 3 hand-written interleaved-transaction tests demonstrating SI
  abort-on-conflict end-to-end: immediate abort on write-write conflict,
  lock release on commit, lock release on abort.
- **Final state:** 80 unit tests + 9 crash-harness tests (P1–P9) green,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --all --check`
  clean, `cargo build --release` succeeds.
- **Next:** M1.c — catalog (`catalog.rs`) + SQL subset (`src/sql/`), with
  RC's re-evaluation path landing inside the UPDATE/DELETE executor and
  RLS's AND-rewrite landing in the logical planner.

### 2026-07-06 — M1.a checkpoint complete (MVCC core)

- Implemented all of M1.a per the approved plan
  (`/Users/sagarmahamuni/.claude/plans/misty-hugging-brook.md`): tuple header
  extension, control-file catalog_root field, WAL user-txn records, MVCC
  visibility logic, transaction manager, MVCC-aware heap rewrite, recovery's
  user-txn undo pass, on_read/on_write seam, P6/P7 crash tests.
- Two design deviations from the original plan discovered during
  implementation and corrected (see design notes above): (1) abort requires
  immediate physical undo, not something deferrable to M1.b; (2) no
  version-chain walk in `Heap::get` — no cross-statement RowId stability.
- Fixed a real bug introduced mid-session: `recovery.rs`'s `redo_record`/
  `undo_record` still assumed M0's WAL_INSERT/WAL_UPDATE payload semantics
  (bare payload / full replacement) after `heap.rs` changed what those
  records actually carry (versioned-insert encoding / bare xmax value).
  Fixed by decoding the new payload shapes explicitly.
- Also closed out M0 in this session: ran `cargo bench --release` (some
  benchmarks took several minutes each due to per-op fsync), recorded the
  metrics table in `PROGRESS.md` with a lightweight SQLite CLI/Python-driver
  baseline comparison, and fixed pre-existing repo-wide `cargo fmt` drift
  that predated this session (confirmed via `git stash` before touching it).
- **Final state:** 71 unit tests + 8 crash-harness tests (P1–P7) green,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean, `cargo fmt --all --check`
  clean, `cargo build --release` succeeds.
- **Next:** M1.b — lock manager, SI abort-on-conflict (built and tested
  before RC's re-evaluation path, per D12), crash test P9.

### 2026-07-06 — M0 implementation (Tasks 1–10)

- Created all M0 source modules from scratch (Tasks 1–10).
- Fixed D5 enforcement: `write_page` is in-memory only (no D5 check); D5 is
  enforced at `flush_page()` and `find_victim()` eviction.
- Fixed `mmap.rs` `unsafe` isolation: crate uses `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`, mmap
  module uses `#![allow(unsafe_code)]`.
- Fixed WAL BufWriter flush ordering: tests that scan the WAL now commit (fsync)
  before scanning so records are durable on disk.
- **Final state:** `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean, 30 unit tests + 6 crash
  harness tests all green.
- **Next:** Run benchmarks (`cargo bench --release`), record results in
  `PROGRESS.md`, mark M0 done.

### 2026-07-06 — Project initialization
- Architecture design doc reviewed; six foundational gaps identified and resolved.
- Isolation decided: RC default / RR available / SSI seam now (D10–D12).
- Scope adjusted: single-file for M0 (D6); benchmark the replaced stack (§6).
- `CLAUDE.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `MEMORY.md` created.
