# Backlog index

> The **single at-a-glance registry** of every backlog effort — its number, type,
> and status (pending vs completed) — plus what's planned next. Naming & lifecycle
> rules: [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md). Shipped metrics: `PROGRESS.md`.
>
> **The number is a stable ID** (assigned once, never renumbered — links stay
> valid). **Existing files keep their names**; every **new** backlog file is named
> `NN_<slug>.md` where `NN` is its number here. **Next new file → `15_…`.**
> "What to do next" is the **Next up** section below (reorder freely — priority is
> not the ID).

## Registry

| # | file | type | status |
|--:|------|------|--------|
| 01 | `phase1_acid_hardening.md` | Phase | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Phase 1) |
| 02 | `phase2_data_model.md` | Phase | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: P2.a–P2.e) |
| 03 | `phase3_durable_storage.md` | Phase | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Phase 3) |
| 04 | `phase4_query_power.md` | Phase | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Phase 4) |
| 05 | `phase5_concurrency.md` | Phase | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Phase 5) |
| 06 | `phase6_ops_ha.md` | Phase | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Phase 6) |
| 07 | `commit_time_fsync.md` | Improvement | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Commit-time WAL fsync) |
| 08 | `pg_baseline_comparison.md` | Performance | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Postgres baseline comparison) |
| 09 | `autovacuum.md` | Improvement | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Autovacuum) |
| 10 | `durable_fsm_catalog_pagelist.md` | Improvement | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Durable on-disk FSM) |
| 11 | `index_write_concurrency.md` | Improvement | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Index & heap write concurrency) |
| 12 | `rest_api_enrichment.md` | Improvement | ⬜ NOT STARTED |
| 13 | `crud_performance.md` | Performance | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: CRUD performance — Phase A + B) |
| 14 | `parallel_scan.md` | Milestone | ✅ SHIPPED (PROGRESS: Milestone P + follow-ups) |

Meta docs (not numbered work items): `roadmap.md` (the numbered-phase plan),
`CONVENTIONS.md` (this standard), `engine_internals_doc_prompt.md` (tooling).

## Next up (candidates — pick one, then create `NN_<slug>.md`)

Ordered by my current ROI read; reorder as priorities change. None has its own
file yet — each is *filed inside* an existing doc until started.

1. **`15_hot_update.md` — A2 / HOT-style update** (write-path parity; UPDATE is
   ~0.34× vs PG). The biggest *remaining* single lever, but the highest risk:
   heap version-model + **on-disk format** (`FORMAT_VERSION` bump, D4 sign-off) +
   recovery + new crash points; honest gain only ~0.34× → ~0.42×. Filed in
   `crud_performance.md`.
2. **`12` `rest_api_enrichment.md`** — the one already-filed NOT-STARTED item.
3. **Parallel-scan follow-ups** (filed in `parallel_scan.md`, lower ROI):
   `SUM`/`AVG`/`GROUP BY` partial aggregate; `LIMIT` early-stop; server
   `ReadHandle` parallelism; a visibility-map fast count. Flip the parallel-scan
   toggle **default-on** after a soak.

## How to update this file

- **Start** an item → set status to 🔄 IN PROGRESS; if it's a "Next up"
  candidate, create its `NN_<slug>.md` (next free number) and add a Registry row.
- **Ship** it → status → ✅ SHIPPED with the `PROGRESS.md` entry name.
- Keep this the source of truth for *what exists and where it stands*; keep
  metrics in `PROGRESS.md` and running state in `MEMORY.md`.
