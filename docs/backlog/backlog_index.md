# Backlog index

> The **single at-a-glance registry** of every backlog effort — its number, type,
> and status (pending vs completed) — plus what's planned next. Naming & lifecycle
> rules: [`CONVENTIONS.md`](CONVENTIONS.md). Shipped metrics: `PROGRESS.md`.
>
> **The number is a stable ID** (assigned once, never renumbered — links stay
> valid). **Existing files keep their names**; every **new** backlog file is named
> `NN_<slug>.md` where `NN` is its number here. **Next new file → `35_…`.**
> "What to do next" is the **Next up** section below (reorder freely — priority is
> not the ID).

Meta docs (not numbered work items): `roadmap.md` (the numbered-phase plan),
`CONVENTIONS.md` (this standard), `engine_internals_doc_prompt.md` (tooling).
**Next new file → `35_…`.**

## Next up (candidates — pick one, then create `NN_<slug>.md`)

Ordered by my current ROI read; reorder as priorities change. Create each
candidate's `NN_<slug>.md` when started — until then each is *filed inside* an
existing doc.

0. **Item 18 — Engine access & introspection contract — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-13**
   (branch `18-engine-access-contract-impl`). Delivered the `information_schema`-
   style **queryable catalog** (`information_schema.{tables,columns,
   table_constraints,key_column_usage,referential_constraints}` +
   `unidb_catalog.indexes`) as synthesized virtual relations SELECTable over the
   normal query surface — no app REST endpoints — plus the Application Builder's
   Guide (`docs/engine_access_guide.md`) stitching the access/query/type/error
   surface together. Pure read-side projection over metadata that already
   parses+persists (M11); no format bump. Metrics/closeout in `PROGRESS.md`.

1. **Item 11 `UNIDB_CONCURRENT_SQL_WRITES` default-ON flip — ✅ SHIPPED
   2026-07-13** (branch `11-concurrent-writes-default-on`). Item 16 (below)
   root-caused and fixed the soak blocker (MVCC visibility anomaly); the
   concurrency matrix passes 28/28 toggle-on **and** toggle-off at
   `CONC_REPEATS=10`. Default is now ON (`=0`/`false`/`off` forces the serialized
   fallback); Table C re-measured on the flipped default: indexed 8-writer
   **811 → 1016 commits/s** (+25%). Flip note in `index_write_concurrency.md`,
   metrics in `PROGRESS.md`. **Item 16 — MVCC visibility anomaly under
   concurrent SQL writes — is ✅ SHIPPED** (2026-07-12, branch
   `16-visibility-fix`); root cause (abort dropped the xid from `active` before
   undo), fix, and evidence live in
   `16_concurrent_sql_writes_visibility_anomaly.md`; metrics in `PROGRESS.md`.
2. **A2 / HOT-style update — DEFERRED (ROI vs §1), not filed.** Would reopen
   locked decision D4 (`FORMAT_VERSION` bump) + recovery + new crash points for a
   ~0.34× → ~0.42× UPDATE-bulk gain on a **single-model** CRUD bench that §1 says
   we should lose anyway. Not worth a locked-decision change; effort redirected to
   #17 (the §6 cross-domain headline). Filed rationale in `crud_performance.md`; if
   ever picked up it takes the next free number (`25_…`).
3. **Parallel-scan follow-ups** (filed in `parallel_scan.md`, lower ROI):
   `SUM`/`AVG`/`GROUP BY` partial aggregate; `LIMIT` early-stop; server
   `ReadHandle` parallelism; a visibility-map fast count. (Default-on + worker
   governance already shipped as #15.)
4. **Item 19 — SQL surface gaps (`19_sql_surface_gaps.md`, NOT STARTED).** The
   tracked list of unsupported query constructs surfaced by Milestone 18's guide:
   `CASE`/`COALESCE` (G1, and the blocker for `FULL OUTER … USING`), `FULL OUTER
   JOIN` (G2), set ops `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT` (G3), `ORDER BY` on a
   non-projected expr (G4), `RETURNING` (G5), `NATURAL JOIN` (G6, low ROI —
   desugars to the now-supported `USING`), window funcs / recursive CTEs (G7,
   milestone-sized), `SELECT` without `FROM` (G8), **`LIKE`/`ILIKE` pattern
   matching (G9, high ROI — the studio record browser lost contains/starts/ends
   filters to it)**, and **row-path predicate parity for `IS NULL`/`LIKE` so
   filters work off the planner path incl. under `NEAR` (G10)**. Pick individual
   row-path predicate parity for `IS NULL`/`LIKE` (G10), and **full-text search
   has no SQL/REST surface — embed-only `Engine::search_fulltext`, unusable from a
   browser (G11)**. Pick individual gaps as focused improvements; the doc carries
   a per-gap scope/ROI read.
5. **Attach-client session support** (filed in `rest_api_enrichment.md`,
   shipped item 12's one optional follow-up): wrap `X-Txn-Id` sessions +
   `/rows/batch` + cursors in `unidb-attach`.
7. **Storage/recovery follow-ups (filed 2026-07-13 from the guide's limitations
   table; engine-internal, so higher risk than the service lanes — crash
   harness is the hard gate):** **#26 event queue at scale** (sequence index →
   O(new events) polling + push-vs-poll; highest ROI, directly improves item
   20's dispatcher), **#27 vacuum** (per-table accounting + cost throttle +
   whole-table compaction; most self-contained), **#28 replication**
   (time-based PITR + logical replication; milestone-sized). **Parallel note:
   #26 and #28 both edit `lib.rs`+`wal.rs` — do NOT run them concurrently; #27
   (`autovacuum.rs`+`heap.rs`) is safe to run alongside either.**
6. **Supabase-track service milestones (filed 2026-07-13, ordered by
   recommended build sequence — each has its own spec file):**
   **#20 events/realtime dispatcher** (~80% exists in-engine via M4; highest
   demo value; unblocks #23's outbox) → **#21 observability metrics
   enrichment — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-13** (branch `21-observability-metrics`;
   lock-free per-chokepoint metrics via `stats()`/`GET /stats` + `/metrics`;
   the horizon-age gauge is the item-16 lesson; widget-traceability table in
   `docs/engine_access_guide.md` §9) → **#22 logs surface** (JSON + correlation
   ids + bounded `/logs`) →
   **#23 storage service — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-13** (branch `23-storage-service`,
   PR #64; `unidb-storage` crate — MinIO/S3 over engine metadata + LOB tiering,
   outbox/reconciler, presigned URLs; engine unchanged) → **#24 authz v2**
   (per-op RLS policies + `WITH CHECK` + SQL-native roles; deliberately last —
   deepest semantics).
7. **#25 multi-page catalog** (`25_multipage_catalog.md`, Improvement, NOT
   STARTED) — **surfaced by #23**: the whole catalog (table defs + stats) is one
   ~8 KiB page blob, so a wide schema / accumulated stats overflow with
   `HeapFull`; #23 had to work around it (compact schema, DDL up front). Extends
   item 10 (which moved page-lists out). Recommended first cut: split `stats`
   out of the blob; then evaluate multi-page vs self-hosting catalog.

## How to update this file

- **Start** an item → set status to 🔄 IN PROGRESS; if it's a "Next up"
  candidate, create its `NN_<slug>.md` (next free number) and add a Registry row.
- **Ship** it → status → ✅ SHIPPED with the `PROGRESS.md` entry name.
- Keep this the source of truth for *what exists and where it stands*; keep
  metrics in `PROGRESS.md` and running state in `MEMORY.md`.
